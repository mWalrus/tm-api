# TM API
This is a small API serving my [MapRank plugin](https://github.com/mWalrus/MapRank).

## Usage
If you want to host this yourself you'll need to:
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/mWalrus/tm-api`
2. Create a new ubisoft account
3. Add that account's credentials to a `auth.key` file in the project root like so: `example@email.com:password`
